To find your pipeline YAML files:

    In your GitHub repository: Look for files named:
        buildspec.yml
        or buildspec.yaml
        (in the root directory)
        .aws/buildspec.yml
        Any custom buildspec files referenced in your pipeline stages

    In the AWS Console: You can view the pipeline configuration by:
        Clicking on any of your pipeline names in the CodePipeline console
        Going to the "Edit" section to see the detailed stage configurations
        Checking the "Build" stages (if any) for buildspec file references

    Download pipeline definition: In the CodePipeline console, you can:
        Select a pipeline
        Click "Edit"
        Use "Download pipeline for AWS CLI" to get the JSON/YAML definition

Would you like me to help you with a specific pipeline, or are you looking for buildspec files for a particular build process?
