Based on the information and your current setup, here are several ways to add environment variables to fix your 500 internal server error:

Method 1: Through Elastic Beanstalk Console (Recommended)
Go to your Elastic Beanstalk environment:

Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk console
Select one of your environments (AfterSchool-env, AfterSchoolLessons-env, SCHOOLTEST-env, or CUSTOMPIPE)
Add environment variables:

Click Configuration in the left navigation
Under Updates, monitoring, and logging section, click Edit
Scroll down to Runtime environment variables
Click Add environment variable
For Source select Plain text
Add your variables (common ones that fix 500 errors):
DATABASE_URL = your_database_connection_string
API_KEY = your_api_key
NODE_ENV = production
PORT = 8080
SECRET_KEY = your_secret_key

Click Apply to save changes
Method 2: Using AWS CLI
eb setenv DATABASE_URL=your_db_url API_KEY=your_key NODE_ENV=production --region ap-south-1

Run in CloudShell
Method 3: Using .ebextensions Configuration Files
Create a file in your GitHub repository at .ebextensions/environment-variables.config:

option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    DATABASE_URL: "your_database_url"
    API_KEY: "your_api_key"
    NODE_ENV: "production"
    PORT: "8080"
    SECRET_KEY: "your_secret_key"

Method 4: For Sensitive Variables (Recommended for secrets)
Use AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store:

In Elastic Beanstalk console:
Add environment variable
For Source select Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store
Enter the ARN of your secret/parameter
Common Environment Variables That Fix 500 Errors:
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
PORT=8080
API_BASE_URL=your_api_url
SECRET_KEY=your_app_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CORS_ORIGIN=your_frontend_url

Important Notes:
Size Limit: All environment variables combined cannot exceed 4,096 bytes
Restart Required: Environment will restart when you add variables
Check Logs: After adding variables, check Elastic Beanstalk logs for any remaining errors
To Check What Variables Your App Needs:
Look in your GitHub repository (obdaguy-create/STUDENT_PARENTS_AFTER_SCHOOL_LESSONS_BACKEND) for:

.env.example file
Configuration files
Database connection code
Any process.env.VARIABLE_NAME references
Which method would you like to try first? I recommend starting with the Elastic Beanstalk console method as it's the most straightforward.
